# Event Ticketing System

A Python-based application for managing a simple event ticketing system. This system allows users to register, purchase VIP or Regular tickets, and provides real-time updates on ticket availability. Priority handling ensures VIP ticket requests are processed before Regular requests, and all transactions are logged for future reference.

## Project Overview


The Event Ticketing System is designed to:
- Manage ticket purchases for an event, giving priority to VIP ticket holders.
- Track ticket availability in real time, displaying updated counts.
- Log all transactions (successful or unsuccessful) for easy reference and auditing.

## Features

- **User Registration & Ticket Purchase**: Users can register by providing their name and selecting a ticket type (VIP or Regular).
- **Priority Ticket Queue Management**: Tickets are managed in separate queues for VIP and Regular, with VIP tickets prioritized.
- **Real-Time Availability**: Ticket availability for VIP and Regular types is updated live as tickets are purchased.
- **Transaction Logging**: Each ticket purchase is logged, including user name, ticket type, and purchase time. Unsuccessful attempts are also recorded.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A text-based menu guides users through registration, ticket purchasing, and checking availability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Data Structures Used

- **Priority Queues**: Separate queues manage VIP and Regular ticket requests.
- **Dictionaries**: Used for storing ticket availability and user details.
- **File Logging**: Transactions are stored in a text file for easy tracking.
